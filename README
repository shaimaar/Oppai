==================
=  Description:  =
==================

Implementation of client side of shape drawing game. Each client may connect
the server by providing a DNS address (local as 'localhost' or public
'e-intro.cs.huji.ac.il'), port (8000-8003), user name and group name. If
there's already an existing group with that name, the client will join that
group. Else, a new group with that name will be created. The list of users
in the GUI will be updated as users join and leave the platform.
To create a new shape the client must choose a shape and color. The default
color is blue and the default shape is a line.
